# Pyranha
This is a program, which can do lots of fun stuff, using only windows functions
In order to run the program, you need to start the file Pyranha.bat
Maybe, I'll develop a linux version, too, but it may not have the same options.
I'm still updating this, so be sure to take a loot at It every day, but I don't really have more ideas,
that's why I want you to give me some.

I'll try to reply to them, but I'm not sure if i can do all of them.

See you at 1.4!
